- ^1. Require `api28` variant, not available for play store `apilatest` version
- ^2. Require `Run as Administrator`, elevated user share configuration with original user
- ^3. Require root, root DOES NOT share configuration with original user
- ^4. Require root, root DOES NOT share configuration with original user. Move the app to Application folder and run `sudo /Applications/anyportal.app/Contents/MacOS/anyportal`.
- ^5. Require an apple developer license to even debug an app that uses Network Extension. Dev progress currently blocked. The iOS app would serve little purpose right now without tun.
- ^3. Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 with Gnome
- ^7. Require root / [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku)

- âš« Not Planned: impossible / no plans / discontinued
- ðŸŸ¡ Planned: planned / under development
- ðŸ”µ Experimental: experimental implementation / testing
- ðŸŸ¢ Working: functioning as expected
- ðŸ”´ Not Working: dev blocked / known issues / non-functional

## Technical details for power users

- why v2ray/xray over sing-box?
  - load balancing
  - chained proxy in transport layer
  - better server-side functions (gRPC interface etc.), so we choose it also as client to reduce maintenance
- remote profile has only one required field, a REST URL pointing to a v2ray config
- for v2ray to work properly on Android and iOS, tun2socks is necessary
  - v2ray native tun inbound is only half finished for now
  - tun2socks with best performance so far: hev-socks5-tunnel, followed by sing-box
  - you can use anyportal with tun disabled on Android, and use external tools to redirect traffic to a socks port, just like on desktop
- android api 29+ does not allow running binary directly
  - you can run custom cores (any version of v2ray, xray) with apk compiled with api target 28
  - playsotore always requires recent api targets, way over 28 now, so you can only use an embedded core with playstore apk

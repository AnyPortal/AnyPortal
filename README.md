- ^1. Require `api28` variant, not available for play store `apilatest` version.
  - The core exec asset is copied to internal storage upon selection, so you MUST reselect the core if you want to update it.
  - The `working directory` can not be set to a location without execution permission, e.g. the sdcard which has a FAT file system.
  - You MUST manually specify the `envs` if the core needs it, e.g. `{"xray.location.asset" : "/storage/emulated/0/path/to/xray/assets"}`
- ^2. Only latest xray-core is embedded for now.
- ^3. Require `Run as Administrator`, elevated user share configuration with original user
- ^4. Require root, root DOES NOT share configuration with original user
- ^5. Require root, root DOES NOT share configuration with original user. Move the app to Application folder and run `sudo /Applications/anyportal.app/Contents/MacOS/anyportal`.
- ^6. Require an apple developer license to even debug an app that uses Network Extension. Dev progress currently blocked. The iOS app would serve little purpose right now without tun.
- ^7. Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 with Gnome

## Technical details for power users

- why v2ray/xray over sing-box?
  - load balancing
  - chained proxy in transport layer
  - better server-side functions (gRPC interface etc.), so we choose it also as client to reduce maintenance
- remote profile has only one required field, a REST URL pointing to a v2ray config
- for v2ray to work properly on Android and iOS, tun2socks is necessary
  - v2ray native tun inbound is only half finished for now
  - tun2socks with best performance so far: hev-socks5-tunnel, followed by sing-box
  - you can use anyportal with tun disabled on Android, and use external tools to redirect traffic to a socks port, just like on desktop
- android api 29+ does not allow running binary directly
  - you can run custom cores (any version of v2ray, xray) with apk compiled with api target 28
  - playsotore always requires recent api targets, way over 28 now, so you can only use an embedded core with playstore apk
